Introduction:
-------------
This document explains how to make a new branch in git, which we would use generally to explore the implementation of a new feature.

When a feature branch is ready for review (and possible assimilation into the master branch), this can be accomplished on the Github website using a "pull request".

How to make a feature branch:
-----------------------------
1) git branch
-> shows all branches including the one you're on.

2) git checkout master
-> make sure you are on the master branch before making a new feature branch.

3) git checkout -b newFeature
-> creates a new feature branch called 'newFeature' and places you on this branch.

Typing 'git branch' should now show that you are in this new branch.

Now, implement the new feature: modify, add, and delete code accordingly.
To add a new file to git, type git add <file>.

When you are ready to commit, type
4) git commit -am 'Message goes here'
-> in general, it is useful to have a message associated with every commit.

5) git push -u origin newFeature
->this pushes the changes you've made on this branch.

If you accidentally make a bunch of changes on master and want to move them to a new branch, you can do so by typing

git push --set-upstream origin ui
-> ui is set upstream

git push -u origin ui
-> pushes changes to ui


How to make a code review:
--------------------------
on Github, navigate to the branch of choice, and make a code review.
Once everyone approves, we can merge this into the master.
