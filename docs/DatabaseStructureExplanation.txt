	name
		the text of the word itself. Just a simple string!

	part_of_speech
		the part (or parts) of speech associated with this word.
		For example: noun, adjective, or verb.

	tags
		a list of strings associated with a specific abstract idea.
		The list of tags are associated with the word so that
		in the generation of acrostics, the themes are readily
		available.

	valuation
		a floating point number conferring some sense of 'value'.
		This is useful when semi-randomly selecting words, as
		words with a higher valuation are more likely to be
		selected for acrostic generation.

Acrostic:
	vertical_word
		The vertical word formed by taking the first letter of every
		component word or phrase in the acrostic.
	horizontal_words
		The list of words or phrases that comprise the rows of the 
		acrostic.  Words are separated by a semicolon.
	theme
		An abstract topic or category associated with an acrostic.  At some point,
		this may be specified by the user (they could choose to generate
		a "cute animal" acrostic, for example, or a "religion" acrostic).
	construction_id
		See Construction.construction_id.

Construction:
	construction
		Describes the parts of speech acceptable for the horizontal words
		in the acrostic.  Usually, a sequence of the parts of speech
		of each horizontal word: "any-noun-noun-adjective-noun", for example,
		where the vertical word is any part of speech, the first horizontal 
		word is a noun, the second is  noun, the third is an adjective, and
		the fourth is a noun.
	construction_id
		A name associated with the specific sequence of parts of speech
		associated with the horizontal words in the acrostic.  This field
		helps describe the construction field in a human-meaningful way
		(like "texas" or "shakespearean" instead of "noun-noun-adjective-noun")
